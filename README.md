# FindFIbonacciSeries
Find the fibonnaci series given an input set
The code test is to write a piece of code that will print out the fibonacci sequence. The user should enter a value (N), and the program should print out the first N entries in the fibonacci sequence.

What is the Fibonacci sequence?

# Solution (Fibonacci Series)
- Initialized the starting values to be 0 and 1
- Validate if the input supplied is 1 and return the 0,1 
- Then initialized the index (iteration) at 2
- Then looped over the input set against the index , till the index is equal to the input.
- return the result.

# Time complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(N) i.e linear time complexity. This means that as the input grows, the algorithm takes proportionally longer to complete.
